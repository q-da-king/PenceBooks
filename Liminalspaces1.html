        <h3>IntrO</h3>
        <p>
          Hello. I am Jason. A 9-Year old boy who has always loved to explore
          creepy and blocked-off areas. People always tell me that I am a big
          weirdo for DOING this, but, yeah. That’s how people are if you do dumb
          things. In my eyes there not dumb they are a chance for an amazing
          adventure. This is my story on how I got to these liminal spaces and a
          lot of others, so, if you're interested, keep on reading.
        </p>
        <h3>Chapter 1: In reality</h3>
        <p>
          I was in my warm bed tightly snuggled up with my favorite stuffed
          animal, Kitty Kat who had soft cotton to cover her stuffed small body.
          I woke up with a fright when I heard the cat alarm ring louder than
          ever! “AHHHHHH!” I screamed as I quickly sat up in my bed. I laid back
          down and decided to get some more sleep but then I remembered, SCHOOL.
          If you're wondering why I’m having nightmares I just exited the
          backrooms, so I am a little jumpy. “Mom?” I called, expecting an
          answer from her. I was going to ask her for breakfast. “Where are
          you?” Oh yeah, she’s at work. “Uhhhh” I groaned as I slowly rolled out
          of bed and gently placed my now cold feet on the wood. I walked onto
          the old wood floor and grabbed the pan I hang on my bathroom door
          every night even though my mom says it’s stupid but I do it for my
          comfort and she doesn't know how I feel. I walked into the dark
          bathroom with the cooking pan hoping there were no entities there, but
          there weren't. Of course, I’m still a bit scared. I picked up my
          toothbrush with a peeling cat sticker on it from my fifth-birthday
          party that I’d had forever and was completely gross. I could feel that
          fuzzy morning feeling you get in your mouth. So, I brushed my teeth
          until they sparkled with delight and the yucky feeling disappeared. I
          got on my red t-shirt (that had a pasta sauce stain and my moms
          constantly telling me to throw it away), and gray sweatpants that had
          a small cat at the top of the leg and opened the dusty red door I
          opened the door with the brass door handle and headed out the door in
          a rush. I had to get to school! I sprinted over leaves that had fallen
          from the old oak tree whose branches hang above us, seeming like they
          were going to fall in a thunderstorm, rain storm or just any time of
          day but no they never have fallen. The tree is strong if you ask me.
          Hearing that constant crunch. I was running so fast and enjoying the
          breeze so much, I didn't notice that I went RIGHT PAST my school and
          into the field. I could feel the tall grass swaying in the wind by my
          sweatpants. When I opened my eyes it was too late. My foot got snagged
          on a rock. I tripped and fell on a hill. I lay there for a while to
          catch my breath on the dirt with the grass taunting me to get up. I
          could feel my lungs burning and my knees on fire with pain. I kept
          telling myself I can’t be late for school, can't be late for school.
          Until finally I had the energy to get up. I loosened up and with a
          burst of energy jumped up and over-rotated!? Now I thought I had the
          energy to do anything. I once again this time carefully got up. I
          started to run again and continued to run until I saw my school bus. A
          yellow regular old school bus. I climbed up the steps and found a seat
          in the back where I sat in a scratched seat and asked “Can we head
          towards Harper Middle school?” I sat there for about 6 hours. Crossing
          schools (but not mine), towns big and small and large mountain ranges,
          and pretty much anything you can think of it was quite weird if you
          ask me. “Are we at my school yet?” I questioned the bus driver “Not
          quite there.” 6 hours later… “Are we there yet?” I asked the second
          time “Not there yet.” 57 hours later… “OKAY. WE GOT TO BE THERE NOW.”
          I shouted in anger. “Not quite there :)” He said as we screeched to a
          sudden halt and I mean sudden like from 100 miles per hour to 0 and I
          went airborne and flew out the window. I flew super high then I braced
          for impact on a hill. It was pretty exhilarating because this is the
          closest I could get to flying. I came in hard and hit my head
          smack-dab on a rock and my body hit on the weeds below. Expecting to
          be harmed I was surprisingly not. I seemed to be healed. But I didn't
          go through the ground like I entered the backrooms. I lifted my head
          to see that I was, again, no longer in reality but it didn't look like
          I was in the backrooms… So where was I? I got up to answer that
          question by looking for things that may signify me being in the
          backrooms or not. I sure hope I wasn’t in the backrooms again.
        </p>
        <h3>Chapter 2: A Gloomy forest</h3>
        <p>
          I was exploring and exploring, and exploring every corner of this new
          place full of species of trees I have never seen, and trust me I’m a
          tree expert. Just then, my curious eyes caught a glimpse of what
          seemed like a cabin. I approached it and sure enough, I’d found myself
          in a cabin that was barricaded. “Huh.” I thought to myself as I walked
          to the backdoor and tried to break in. It didn’t budge. No luck. I
          decided to explore some more. Just then I tripped on something and I
          landed on my hands. I looked at my hands. They weren’t too bad there
          were a couple of scrapes and leaves sticking to them. I turned back to
          look at my knee but to my surprise, I saw a Crowbar! I quickly
          regained my train of thought and ran back to the Backdoor of the
          cabin. To my amazement, there was a, uh BEAR! I jumped at the sight of
          it and then I started to think. Was this the end? I’ve gone exploring
          all these liminal spaces that were sure to kill me but no. What if I
          die to the bear? All those moments. Was I going to let my life slip
          away? No, I was not. I was going to kill him. But when I lifted my
          head back up to kill him. I saw the bear start making these weird
          sounds that sounded like human laughter coming out of him. Oh, and
          what happened next? guess what! The bear unzipped the back of himself
          and was not a bear at all. He was a Human!? He had blue jeans, a red
          t-shirt, and a yellow baseball cap. He just would not stop chuckling.
          When he finally stopped laughing (which seemed like forever) he calmly
          said “Hello.” with a little chuckle in between. What happened next
          should be in all the history books. The guy suddenly was smashed to
          the ground and you know what happened to him? Blood was everywhere.
          What smashed the guy? A real bear. The real bear suddenly faded into
          the forest with the guy. Now that’s liminal. I took a second to put
          that behind me and forget about it. I was now excited again.
          gleefully, I swung the crowbar over my head and slammed it into the
          door wood and dust went everywhere. When everything settled I saw a
          door lying in front of me. Surprisingly the door was unharmed. I
          cracked it open just enough for me to get in. I slowly crept inside.
          Everything was dark in the cabin. I suddenly felt something moving in
          my shoe. It was quite disgusting. I pulled the shoe off with my clammy
          hands,(because that bear incident scared me three-quarters to death).
          Like I was saying I pulled my shoe off to see a lizard. I screamed
          like a baby expecting to see something disgusting. It was pretty cute.
          Now, this was the problem. It ran around me like a maniac with as much
          energy as a hydrogen bomb (the most powerful bomb ever produced). He
          started growing on me. So, I decided to name him Spike. It might be
          good but Nah. Speedypuff to cheesy. What about Puff, Puff will do. The
          way he probably got in was that hole through the dirt floor. I was
          going to need to fix that. I walked up to the closed windows and
          opened them and shut the door. I noticed a small box on the ground. I
          picked it up and felt a rough side. Oh, it's a box of matches. I
          looked at the logo on the side and sure enough, it said BOX O’
          MATCHES. “that’s helpful.” I said under my lips. I slid open the small
          box and grabbed an old match. I rubbed the rough spot on the box but
          it didn't light. I tried again and it didn't light, but the third time
          it lit. “Yes!” I yelled knowing that there wasn’t anybody around
          except Puff. Oh yeah, Puff where was he? Uh, I thought I’ll find him
          after I find a candle and light it. I found a candle but Puff was in
          the candle! It smelled quite good but I could not just light Puff on
          fire. So I dropped the match. I dropped it and grabbed Puff out of the
          candle and snuggled against him. Smoke suddenly went everywhere. When
          everything settled I was in a tunnel that looked like it didn’t belong
          at all with the cabin. The cabin was made of wood, it was old and
          dusty. The tunnel was made of cement and pipes and it was new and
          clean. I went down the tunnel thinking about how different these areas
          were.
        </p>
        <h3>Chaper 3: You'll make new freinds here. I promise</h3>
        <p>
          All I can say is that the tunnel got dark REAL FAST. I wandered around
          for a while. The tunnel was very pristine. After about 10 minutes
          though when it was getting pretty dim it began 5 to get dirty. There
          was a tin can, a cookie packet, and a coffee cup. It began to get
          dark. I mean, it's really dark. After a long time when it was dark I
          heard scratching, knocking, dripping water, and let me tell you, the
          whole ground was… flooded? I sloshed around the dirty water. I then
          noticed that Puff was gone. Worried, I started searching. With my
          hands out and sloshing through the now hip-deep water. Oh and trust me
          it was tiring. I then felt a sudden burn. I quickly remembered that I
          had a scrape on my knee. There was a sudden sound a bit away from me.
          I reached out and it was only a tin can. I put it down, but then again
          I heard something in there moving. I picked it up once again and
          dumped the water out. There he was inside the can. I heard a splat
          from him falling out of the can onto the water. I picked him up and
          could feel his small scales brushing against my calloused hands. Just
          then whoosh! I plummeted down a small waterfall and landed in a small
          body of water. I swam up to the sand nearby. I slid onto the sand. I
          started coughing. It hurt my throat. When I stopped coughing I noticed
          how sticky the sand was. It was also pretty rough. The small pieces of
          sand got stuck in my scrape and burned like crazy. I was looking for a
          waterfall to wash this off when Puff ran right in front of me. Of
          course, I didn’t want to hurt him so I came to a complete stop and
          fell once again. I then spotted a small waterfall. I limped over to it
          and started washing my poor knee. When I tripped on a rock, I fell
          through the waterfall. Into a small area and I was standing behind a
          tree. It was a backyard, an ape costume, chips, and guac, WAIT A
          MINUTE. THIS IS THE ‘ATTACK OF THE APES’ MOVIE SCENE! I suddenly fell
          through the ground this time into a closet. Full of clothes hanging on
          hangers back and forth. Because I hit them when I clipped(teleported).
          I pushed the white doors with wooden sticks slanted sidewise to let
          little light in and stepped out. To be suddenly spotted by an eye with
          a body. I was back in the forest. She had a sweatshirt that looked
          like it was too small. She also had ripped cloth around the rest of
          her. Probably because she looked like a two-ball snowman. With her
          small legs below her big ball (chest) and her large eye above (the
          head) and her long skinny arms. “Hello, there! My name is Daphap. I
          will be your new friend!” she said with a tingle in her voice as the
          words seemed to flow roughly out of her triangle-shaped mouth. I shook
          her hand with a shaking arm, very confused. I slowly backed away into
          nearby bushes. For some reason, the closet I clipped to was outside. I
          was in a neighborhood. I saw multiple poles saying don’t trust the eye
          over and over again don’t trust the eye and again don’t trust the eye.
          I then saw a woman on her porch that looked like she had been
          terrorized. She had ripped clothes on and looked like she hadn’t slept
          for days. She then softly said like it was an important warning well
          shaking “Don't Trust the eye.” multiple people joined her like it was
          a protest. They all kept repeating it again and again “Don’t trust the
          eye!” I’m starting to think that Daphap was the eye. Then I saw a
          poster that said don’t trust the eye and below it, displayed a black
          and white picture of Da Phap. I didn't trust her anyway. When I opened
          my eyes after confirming Daphap was the eye and everybody. Daph was
          circling around me and Daphap had teleported directly in front of me.
          I jumped at the sight of her. Now that I confirmed she was a what
          would I call it I want to be nice “oh” a Monster! I ran and ran but
          she seemed to just keep gaining on me. Then when I looked back to see
          how far away she was now. She wasn’t there. I stopped running. I
          caught my breath and after I calmed down and got a grip on what
          happened. The whole town began to change. It started to get cleaner
          and people walking their dogs on the sidewalk looked like they’d been
          processed by the devil himself. They never blinked and they were all
          grey. I blinked again and this looked like a house from the 11
          century. So, without any worries, I continued to wander around the
          neighborhood despite any food or water.
        </p>
        <h3>Chapter 4: Rainbow</h3>
        <p>
          After about 2-3 hours of walking the sun was still up and I was now in
          the middle of nowhere. It felt like I was going to die. Just to remind
          you again I had no water or food whatsoever. I had sunburns everywhere
          and “HUH!” There it was a house. I finally found a house. Well, a
          house that looked what you would call safe. I took a look at it for a
          second. It had dead 7 unhealthy grass all around it. Unlike the
          outside, the grass in the front yard was green and healthy. It also
          had a rainbow even though there were no clouds anywhere near. I
          decided to walk around the dead grass surrounding the house. The dead
          grass seemed like it was burning. I hopped back on the road. I decided
          I needed to get to the house. I once again hopped on the dead grass
          and quickly ran across. As my feet felt like they were going to be
          chard by the time I got there. After what seemed like ages (even
          though it was like 5 seconds) I got to the healthy grass. The healthy
          grass there was cool like an ice bath. The second I felt how cold and
          damp it was. I sat down as quickly as I could without hurting myself.
          “Oh” and my “oh” my It did feel so good. I also took my shoes off to
          cool them off. Puff was in there. “What the heck!” I yelled hoping
          there was no one in the house. He’s weird, I thought to myself. It
          felt so good though when I touched my burning feet to the ice-cold
          grass. When I’d had enough time freezing myself. I decided to enter
          the strange house. The address said “015” and there was a house mat I
          looked down to see what it said it read “Rainbow”. Strange. At that
          very second, I heard something and when I looked behind me there was
          an entity. It was wearing all-black clothes and looked like a man but
          he was super tall. I studied him jumping around in the backyard. His
          legs were taller than me alone and I was considered tall. He then
          looked at me once again and ran towards me. He charged so fast and
          before I knew it he was behind me. He did it again and again so what
          was he doing? It all pointed to one explanation: he was blind! He just
          did what he did over and over jumping over me well he’s like forty
          feet in the air. I walked up to the door again. Not caring that there
          was a twenty-foot man behind me. I grasped the brass doorknob that
          looked old and worn out. I pushed it open and heard an ear-piercing
          creak, well the blue and broken door opened. I guess the door handle
          was not that warm compared to the door. Oh and also now that I see the
          house. I guess brass is a strong enough material with that though. I
          entered the house only to be greeted by a sign that said “YOU MUST GET
          OUT OF THESE PLACES BEFORE YOU LOSE ALL YOUR SANITY. -THE MESSENGER ''
          I continued to journey on without knowing what that sign meant. I
          walked around a little. I started to feel like I had a headache.
          Probably because I’ve had no water for like fifteen hours. I went down
          the hall and there was a bottle of water. I crept over to it and
          grabbed it and opened it. I just couldn’t get it open so I left it
          there. When I was walking back down the hallway I heard a sound. I
          swiftly turned around to spot that the water bottle's cap was off and
          laying next to it. I walked back over and quickly chugged the whole
          bottle. The headache though just kept getting worse and worse. It now
          was an intense headache. I crawled down on my knees. To notice the
          same thing had happened to my wrists. I curled on the floor. Trying to
          feel less of the agony I was experiencing. It started to get better. I
          just lay there feeling so bad. Not knowing if time could be any
          slower. I then started feeling better.(NOW THAT IT’S ALREADY BEEN 10
          MINUTES!)every second every minute it got a little better. A little
          bit at a time. Another ten minutes passed and I nearly felt good
          enough to get up. So, after 20 minutes of laying on the floor feeling
          like I was being absolutely tortured. It was completely better. I
          carefully got up not knowing if my wrists were going to hurt.
          Surprisingly they were completely better. It was the same for my
          stomach. It felt better. I wandered around. Until I found what looked
          to me like the living room when Daphap randomly appeared behind me and
          said softly, “What are you doing here?” I quickly responded with “Uhh…
          I’m just looking for some supplies. That’s all.” I guess Daphap didn’t
          know that I didn’t trust her at all. She quickly said that she would
          be on her way. She once again faded into thin air. Out of the corner
          of my eye, I spotted an island in the kitchen. I walked over there and
          crossed under an arch into the kitchen. I looked around a little and
          it had yellow outdated paint and some windows with white blinds that
          were open. I walked to the island. The table seemed to be made of
          marble and it was sitting on a wooden platform. There were a couple of
          appliances on it. A toaster with a couple of bread crumbs surrounding
          it, a pitcher of water, a tap sink, and a kitchen towel spread out on
          the table. There was also an ancient TV set. There was a table behind
          it. I walked over to see an opened coca cola bottle. There were four
          bowls of warmed-up pasta. Should I eat some of it? After all, I
          haven't eaten for a long time. I decided to try it out. I sat down in
          the dusty wooden chair and Picked up a small metal fork. The spoon was
          very cold. I dipped the fork into the pasta coated in parmesan. I
          slowly twirled the fork until the noodles were tangled up into a small
          bundle. I lifted the fork full of noodles into the air and into my
          mouth. “AHHH!” I yelled as it fried my mouth. It was extremely hot. I
          went to pick up the coca cola bottle but my finger slipped and it fell
          over, but it didn’t spill, it just teleported somewhere. It was gone.
          I jumped out of my chair and rushed back to the hallway where the
          water bottle sat. I picked it up and drank what was left of
          it(Probably an ounce). After I got all that figured out I continued to
          journey on to find the bedroom. Well, that’s convenient I thought as
          it was right across the hall from the kitchen. I walked under the
          doorway into a room with fire-truck red paint that was peeling. There
          was also a bed with blue polka-dotted sheets that lay on a mattress
          that stands on an old frame looking like it could collapse any minute
          now. Of course, there were some other items including a vanity, a
          piano, some chairs, and a variety of different junk. I was very tired
          from walking around that much. I decided to rest my weary legs by
          laying in bed. I walked over and sat on the edge of the bed and then
          collapsed backward. About ten minutes went by when I spotted a creepy
          painting. Of that tall man outside. What the heck? I thought to
          myself. Just then I had a horrible explanation. This was his house.
          “eh probably not.” I said to myself trying not to scare myself. A
          couple of hours passed and I was looking around the room and mostly
          laying in the bed. Surprisingly the bed was quite comfortable. When I
          decided to explore the backyard of this eerie place. I went through
          the hallways once again and to the backdoor. I opened it and walked
          out to the backyard. It was the same as the front yard but it had a
          playhouse and a human-sized fountain. It was a nice fountain and the
          water was clean. I wondered why that was there so I decided to enter
          the icy water of the fountain.
        </p>
        <h3>Chapter 5: kitchen</h3>
        <p>
          I jumped into the freezing cold water. It was freezing but then I saw
          something. It was a hole at the bottom of the fountain. I was going to
          submerge my whole body underwater. Including my head. This is going to
          be torture I thought to myself. I then thought of the pros though. I
          would get to explore another place. My final decision was to do it. I
          slowly put my whole body underwater. It felt like I was being stabbed
          by a bunch of needles. I swam deeper and deeper. After I had gone
          about thirty feet down. I then saw a tunnel. I was running out of
          breath. I swam into the tunnel. It was barely big enough to fit in. It
          was a tight squeeze and believe me it was scary. Now I thought I was
          going to pass out. When I was about to give up hope. A door slammed
          down behind me and all the water drained. Then a door opened in front
          of me and I walked in. Well slid in(just remind you I’m drenched in
          water). I got up and started walking. I was getting really cold. After
          a long way of walking through this tunnel with water around it. I then
          saw a doorway. Wondering what it was, I ran towards it. I approached
          something that looked like the backrooms. As I was exploring I heard a
          screeching sound. I panicked because I knew this sound. It was a
          Duller! It saw me and I ran for my life. (again.) I found a hole and
          jumped into it but it had a harrowing impact with the floor inside the
          hole. As I inspected my surroundings, I realized that there were 3
          areas that I could see from the start. A closet, A kitchen, and some
          stairs. It was like you just walked in the front door of a house. It
          had this fuzzy carpet with some crumbs embedded in it. I went into the
          kitchen to grab some supplies, (Unlike where Daphap was asking me
          questions.) I stepped under the tall door frame. As I entered the
          kitchen I could hear some ghostly whispers saying things like this:
          “Shut the door” “You will be sorry” and some other things. Then the
          light suddenly turned off. I thought to myself, I probably should shut
          the door now that the lights are off. I ran back to the kitchen door.
          I slid across the kitchen tile and shut it quietly. I inspected the
          kitchen (mostly for food). The kitchen looked pretty modern. Unlike
          the last one. It had some new shiny polka-dotted wallpaper and some
          modern appliances including a large fridge, microwave, and a coffee
          machine. I spotted a small brown bowl sitting in the middle of the
          marble counter. I walked over and tried to peek inside, but I wasn’t
          tall enough. I tried again this time I tried to go on my tippy toes. I
          just couldn’t see inside it though. I looked for something to stand
          on. I then thought why not just climb on the top of the table? When I
          finally saw what was inside there were apples, oranges, and a goldfish
          packet. I quickly grabbed the supplies. I grabbed 1 or 2 apples, a few
          oranges, and the only goldfish packet. When I jumped off the table the
          goldfish packet slipped out of my hands and onto the floor. I bent
          down as quickly as I could and grabbed it. I crossed the kitchen tile
          and up onto the carpet. I opened the door and heard a psst.. sound as
          I ran into the closet.
        </p>
        <h3>Chapter 6: Closet</h3>
        <p>
          When I entered the closet the first thing I noticed was a small box on
          the ground. It was made of brown wood that was old and dusty. When I
          rubbed my sweaty hands against the box I could feel the layers of dust
          collecting on my hand. It must have taken fifteen years to collect on
          that. When I turned it over to see what it was. It had a gray screen
          that was covered in dust (the same as the wood surrounding it.) This
          box has a screen. What was it? It seemed obvious it was a TV—an old
          one. Maybe I’d watch some TV. I’d then have to find an outlet to plug
          the TV in. I started looking. I looked to the left to the right and
          then looked behind me and sure enough, there was a plug right behind
          me. It had two plugs. There was an air freshener in one plug and the
          other one was unused. I looked for a cord on the TV to plug into the
          outlet. I found one hanging off the TV that looked like a snake. I
          picked it up and plugged it in. A few sparks flew off when I plugged
          it in. One landed on a coat that was laying on the floor and started
          to burn. As soon as I noticed it I didn’t know what to do. I looked
          for bottled water or something to smother it with to put it out. It
          was still small enough that I could put it out with my shoe. I got up
          and quickly stepped on it. Over and over until it went out. Smoke went
          everywhere. I started coughing and then more. I felt horrible like I
          was going to pass out or even die. I pushed open the door and as it
          flew open I fell down onto the carpet. I went back in and finished
          setting up the TV. It was harder than anticipated. After I got it set
          up I tried to find the button to turn it on. There was a switch on the
          side so I decided to try that. I flipped the switch and to my
          amazement, it turned on. For only a few seconds though. After about
          three seconds of this weird clown yelling illuminated on the TV
          screen. The TV suddenly turned off and the screen went black. I tried
          again and again. This time I moved the things on top of the TV around.
          I was surprised when it didn’t turn off. I am not saying the screen or
          speakers were good quality compared to today's technology. After
          watching for about ten minutes I noticed a small doll in the corner. I
          also decided I’d spent enough time messing around. I once again
          switched the TV switch and the closet was absent of sound and light
          again. There was still enough light though so I could see objects.
          Like I was saying I picked up the doll. It was taller than the average
          doll(but still nowhere near my height.) He had very long legs too and
          he was wearing all black. Wait for a second, was this a doll of the
          guy I saw outside? “Hmmm?” It seemed like it was exactly identical.
          Now that I think about it, the TV in the kitchen is identical to the
          one in the kitchen. Just then out of the corner of my eye I spotted a
          packet of gum. I picked it up and turned it over(it was upside down.)
          It had a flashy character on the front. The character was one I’d
          never seen before. It was a small book with PG on the front. The
          letters were red and green and the package itself was a light pink
          color. (The people who designed the package probably had very bad
          taste.) I opened the package and to my surprise, there was one piece
          left. I picked up the wrapped piece of chewing gum and began to unwrap
          it. I peeled the paper surrounding it off and plopped it in my mouth.
          It still had a little taste but not much. On the package, it said it
          was blueberry flavored. You couldn’t really taste the blueberry. It
          tasted more like watermelon for some reason. The gum itself was crusty
          and hard. It was somewhat difficult to chew. Just so you know though I
          chew gum a lot. So, it’s sorta nice to chew gum after however long
          I’ve been in these liminal spaces. After chewing the gum for about ten
          minutes I decided that I should get going. I spit it back in the
          wrapper and was on my way. I didn’t know yet if it was light in the
          house. I pushed open the door quickly to check. I was delighted that
          the lights were on and shining bright. I stepped out of the closet not
          wanting to close the door. I didn't, of course. I was rushing. I ran
          away from the closet pretty quickly. I started up the stairs. I
          probably went one or two steps. but, as soon as I set foot on that
          first stair though I knew nothing good was in store for me…
        </p>
        <h3>Chapter 7: Stairs</h3>
        <p>
          The lights were very dim on the stairs, flickering constantly,
          shutting off from time to time, and sometimes they just disappeared.
          The walls were covered in blue wallpaper with flowers. The wallpaper
          was peeling off. By now I was probably one-quarter of the way up the
          stairs(they went up for a long time.) There was a corner I had to turn
          to keep going up. Before I turned the corner I saw another painting of
          the guy I saw outside. By now I was suspecting that something was up.
          I mean the painting of the guy in the bedroom in the other house then
          this one now and the doll in the closet. This was not the same guy I
          saw outside though it looked like his brother?! So, was the other
          house the guy outside, and was this his brother's house? As I turned
          the corner the man in the painting was right in front of me. He was
          very tall. Like as tall as his brother. The only difference though
          this guy was creepy. Super creepy if you look into his eyes you can
          see his soul boiling. His eyes are nearly popping out of his head. I
          thought he was going to attack. He didn’t though he just kept staring
          at me and I kept staring back at him. He got creepier by the second.
          It was like he was possessed by the devil himself. He stands there
          looking straight into my soul and standing five feet taller than me
          just towering above me. You have no idea what this experience was
          like. It felt like I might die just looking at him for too long. After
          what seemed like longer than usual he started to chase me. I ran down
          the stairs as fast as I could. As I turned around to see how far
          behind the entity was when I noticed that he had a metal plate on his
          shoulder. At this point, there were bunches of questions rushing
          through my brain. Something like was this house the man I'm being
          chased by? My most recent one was. Was this man I was being chased by
          a robot? As these thoughts were rushing through my head one more
          joined in. Where was Puff? I kept running and running though. We got
          to the bottom of the staircase. As I turned my head around to check
          how far the man was now. That’s when I noticed Puff was on his
          shoulder. Then I blinked again and the man was on the ground. When I
          went back to inspect I saw Puff was on top of him. He was laying on
          the man's back. Puff was on top of a small blue button just below his
          right shoulder. When I lifted Puff up and he jumped onto my left
          shoulder. I could see that the button he was sitting on said on/off. I
          decided I could take a closer look and figure out if this was a really
          smart robot. So I decided I needed to find some tools. I decided I
          needed to find a garage or an attic. I knew there wasn’t a garage. I
          decided I had to go up the stairs and find an attic. I went up the
          stairs. It took a good twenty minutes. When I finally got up there I
          immediately saw a square shape on the roof. With of course a string
          hanging down from it. I jumped up and barely reached the string. I
          pulled it down and the door to the attic awaited me. It had stairs so
          I stepped up a few stairs and into the attic. It looked exactly like a
          garage. I got my tools and got out. I got a hammer and a screwdriver.
          I went back downstairs. To start dismantling the robot. I took him
          apart piece by piece. He was no robot, he was a clone of that other
          man. Now that is weird, how did he do that?
        </p>
        <h3>Chapter 8: Windows</h3>
        <p>
          I slowly went back upstairs. As usual, it took a while. I thought
          about a couple of things well as I went up the stairs. I thought I
          finally had enough of these dumb areas when I encountered a concrete
          ceiling. The floor was hardwood, the roof was cement, and there were
          graffiti and trash cans everywhere. As I explored this new area, I
          encountered a window face-to-face. And outside the window was this. As
          I was staring at this place I heard a sound. When I listened to this
          sound I knew that it was no good. I ran over to a hallway when IN that
          hallway was more graffiti. I ran back and saw that the stairs going
          back to the level “Stairs” were gone! I had no choice but to run the
          other way. I went over to inspect my choices. This other way had a
          one-million-foot drop down to the bottom! I figured I could leap
          across. To the other side of the cliff. I turned around and walked
          back just enough to get a good long jump. I started running as fast as
          I could and leaped for my life! I barely made it with one hand hanging
          on to the edge. I tried to pull myself up but it was no use. Then
          spotted a rope. I scooted my body over to the rope. I slowly inched up
          the frayed rope until I was up to the flat ground. It felt like such a
          relief. I got up to catch my breath and then started running for my
          life again. I ran and ran. I seemed to be in a desert region. After
          another five minutes of running and the desert region shaped into an
          office building. I finally made it to the exit with this sign, so, I
          continued my journey in these weird spaces.
        </p>
        <h3>Chapter 9: Gumball</h3>
        <p>
          After walking through this for a while away from the exit sign I
          encountered 2 places. A house and a mall. I decided to enter the mall.
          I walked up to it. I entered the mall through automatic doors and into
          a place with white tiling. The ones you would see at an airport. The
          mall looked like one that was from a small town. It had a couple of
          shops and a food court. I explored the first shop. It said in big
          words above a pop-up store “Flower Power ''. I entered that store and
          noticed a gumball machine. It had a blue sign. The sign was made of a
          piece of paper that said: “Out of order.” I saw one tiny gumball that
          was all alone at the bottom. I reached into my pocket looking for a
          quarter. I felt a piece of metal in my pocket and pulled it out. Sure
          enough, it was a quarter. I was delighted. I took the dirty quarter
          out of my pocket that read “1952” to the side of it. There were the
          words ``IN GOD WE TRUST ''. I slid the quarter into the machine and
          twisted the rusted metal. Out came that single gumball that
          mysteriously looked like an eye. I popped it in my mouth and chomped
          it and… Oooh! Sweet watermelon! It was so much better than the gum
          before. As I was saying, I ate it and continued to journey in this
          mall. After an hour or 2 of exploring I found yet another store, but
          this one was called “Make new friends! :)” I entered this store and
          was transported to a new liminal space. THE BACKROOMS LEVEL 94:
          MOTION.
        </p>
        <h3>Chapter 10: Motion</h3>
        <p>
          After a while, I found a single house and I wondered what the heck
          that house was doing there so I entered that creepy, dark house.
          Instantly I began hearing snarling and clawing. After a while of
          exploring the house, I saw a black creature. I ran in the opposite
          direction immediately only to be greeted by another creature. I had no
          idea what to do so I just ran forward. After exploring for a bit, I
          encountered YET ANOTHER HOUSE. As I wondered why there were so many
          houses, I suddenly heard a familiar sound. It was like, “Friend… WHERE
          ARE YOU?” I knew this sound. IT WAS DA PHAP. As I hurried away from
          Daphap, the whole place started to become black with glitches
          everywhere. I didn’t know what to do, so I just finished jumping into
          the house, I was teleported away from the house and into the tunnel of
          glitches. I didn’t know what was behind the tunnel, but I know it
          isn’t good. Just then a loud snarling sound rose up echoing across the
          cave. Just then a dark figure appeared…
