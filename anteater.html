        <h2>Anteater Inside and Out</h2>
        <p>By Jackson Hicks</p>

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          Have you ever seen a furry, long snouted aardvark-like, but furry
          creature? If so, You have seen an anteater! Did you know that only
          5,000 anteaters are left on earth? You will learn all about Anteaters
          and their diets, babies, habitat and more! If you want to know all
          about anteaters, keep reading this amazing and kid friendly book with
          tons of facts and information about these adorable animals!
        </p>
        <h3>Chapter 1: Food</h3>
        <p>
          Did you know that Anteaters eat mainly ants AND termites? An anteater
          can rip up ants and termite’s nests with their powerful forelimbs and
          claws, and then ingest them with their sticky tongue! They are
          surprisingly Omnivores, meaning they eat both plants and other
          animals. Anteaters are edentate animals, which means they have no
          teeth. But their long tongues are more than sufficient to lap up the
          35,000 ants and termites they swallow whole each day! Research has
          found that giant anteaters can identify the particular species of ant
          or termite by smell. When feeding, sticky saliva coats the tongue. The
          2-foot-long tongue is attached to the sternum and can flick in and out
          up to 150 times per minute. They rarely drink, but instead receive
          their water from the foods they eat or possibly moisture left on
          plants after rain! Anteaters are insectivores, which means they eat
          insects, hence the name. Anteaters can also eat other animals such as
          bees. Anteaters have tiny mouths with no teeth and do not chew their
          food. Instead, they have a very strong single- chambered stomach. In
          addition to ants and termites, anteaters also eat soft-bodied grubs,
          soft fruits, and birds' eggs. Anteaters in zoos also eat things like
          fruits, hard-boiled eggs, ground beef, and dog kibble! Anteaters
          aren't picky and are very awesome while eating.
        </p>
        <h3>Chapter 2: Habitat</h3>
        <p>
          You may not know what an anteater’s habitat is, so this subtopic is
          very handy. An anteater lives in South and Central America, so that is
          in south america and the area that connects north and south america.
          Central America borders the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea of the
          Atlantic Ocean. There are 7 countries in Central America, which are
          Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and
          Panama. They are not found in Guatemala or El Savador, where they are
          considered to be extinct. They are also found in tropical savannas and
          forests from southern Mexico to Paraguay and northern Argentina.
          Central America are the countries south of Mexico and north of
          Colombia. South America is all the countries south of Panama. South
          America is Earth's fourth largest continent. It stretches from just
          above the equator down to the Antarctic. It is connected to North
          America by land. The Amazon River runs through South America and is
          surrounded by the world's largest rainforest! South America can be
          divided into three physical regions: mountains and highlands, river
          basins, and coastal plains. Mountains and coastal plains generally run
          in a north-south direction, while highlands and river basins generally
          run in an east-west direction. Anteaters are in a really cool spot,
          and are awesome there.
        </p>
        <h3>Chaper 3: Adorable babies</h3>
        <p>
          Anteater babies are in my opinion the cutest thing on earth! Read this
          subtopic to see what I'm talking about! Females normally give birth to
          one baby after a gestation period of 190 days. Anteater pups cling to
          their mother's back or legs while they are young, and sometimes
          continue to do so for up to a year. Anteaters are called Pups, and
          they are so tiny! An anteater can only give birth to one pup at a
          time. For the first 3 months the pup drinks milk from its mother. And
          after those three months the pup starts eating solids. The solids
          include, well, ANTS! Baby anteaters sleep as much as 15 hours each
          day. They are mostly found on their mom’s back when the adult is
          hunting for food. Anteaters have the absolute, most adorable babies
          which are so cute!
        </p>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
          As you can see, anteaters are super interesting and awesome animals.
          You have learned all about their food, habitat, babies, and
          endangerment. If you want to learn more about them, go to your local
          library or a website! I hope you enjoyed
