        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          Ring! Ring! Your phone is ringing and it’s on the counter, but you
          just sat down. Your about to get up but then remember you just
          received your new smartwatch. You pick your wrist up and press a
          button the smart watches touch screen and receive and complete the
          phone call from your couch. You’ve probably heard about these
          wonderful compact computer on your wrist, but they are worth learning
          more about their history, types, how they work, and their future.
        </p>
        <h3>Chapter 1: History</h3>
        <p>
          The smartwatch that connects to your phone and allows you to do so
          many things wasn’t always this way. Infact, the first smartwatch was
          only a calculator. Introduced in 1976 and known as the Pulsar Time
          Computer Calculator. It was merely a diamond on your wrist retailing
          for $2,100. The luxury design was covered in 18-karat gold and
          retailed for a mind boggling $4,000. Today that’s equal to 25,000
          dollars. The first smartwatch that could connect to your phone was the
          Microsoft SPOT (Small Personal Object Technology). Which provided live
          weather, stock prices, sport results, news and much more. The user
          could also receive email, but could not respond. As you can see the
          smartwatch has an interesting history.
        </p>
        <h3>Chapter 2: Diffrent kinds</h3>
        <p>
          There are many different types of smart watches including phone
          watches, general watches, and outdoors watches. The most popular
          smartwatch is by far just a general smartwatch. There are many reasons
          they are most popular, but one of the most important ones are they
          have a lower price range. They can also complete almost everything you
          need. The second most popular is the phone watch. One reason it comes
          in second is because people look at the price and normally
          automatically walk away. They are actually pretty amazing because they
          are just a phone that fits onto your wrist, but are less expensive
          than an actual phone. They have almost all the same functions. Not far
          behind is the outdoors watch. This type of watch normally doesn't have
          all the same functions as a general or phone watch. Its main purpose
          though, is to count your steps, keep track of your vitals and provide
          the weather forecast, and time. One more function it has is an
          extremely extended battery life incase you don’t have access to a
          charger for a while. As you can see there are three main types of
          watches that all serve different purposes and complete different
          things.
        </p>
        <h3>Chaper 3: How they work</h3>
        <p>
          You might think General Smart watches are complex and require lots of
          parts and pieces, but they aren’t as complicated as you might think.
          The first thing is how a smart watch see’s your vitals. First off,
          have you noticed that small LED light on your watch that’s usually red
          or green and sensors around it. These measure the changes of blood
          flow and how many times a minute your heart beats. It can also do the
          same thing with your blood oxygen saturation levels. If you're
          wondering how you receive text messages and phone calls then keep
          reading. The smart watch connects to your cell phone with bluetooth.
          That way it can receive live news, weather and much more through your
          phone's connection to the internet. So if your phone gets called, it
          can send it through bluetooth to your watch. As you can see smart
          watches work in interesting ways.
        </p>
        <h3>Chapter 4: Future</h3>
        <p>
          Smart watches have a bright future with us. Possibly in the future
          cell phones will be obsolete and we will just use are watch. Infact,
          they already have the technology to shrink a phone down to the size of
          your wrist. So, it’s just a matter of time. Also in a few years maybe
          we can have projectors on are watches. To watch videos and to do video
          calls. Someday you might have a watch that can do everything. All I
          know though is that we have a bright future with technology.
        </p>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
          As you can see smart watches make all of are life's easier. Now that
          you have learned more about smart watche's history, different kinds,
          How they work, and their future. Now that you have learned some
          general information about smartwatches go to your local library and
          find out more about them. I hope you enjoyed
