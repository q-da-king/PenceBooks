        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          Did you know that the siamese cats are one of the most royal types of
          cat breed? In this book you will learn about the siamese cat’s
          Appearance, History, and Pros and Cons! If you want to know all about
          these amazing animals, keep reading this amazing essay all about
          SIAMESE CATS!
        </p>
        <h3>Chapter 1: Appearance</h3>
        <p>
          The siamese cats are medium cats, and weigh from 8-15 lbs. (pounds).
          There are 2 types of Siamese: Traditional and Extreme. Both of them
          share the same colorations, it’s just their body is different. Cat
          associations prefer the extreme type, rather than the traditional. So
          much so that the traditional types are not to be competed as Siamese
          cats, but they are called Thai Cats. Their eye color is blue and
          almond-shaped, and their body colors are tan and brown, with partial
          black on the tail, paws and head. This type of coloration is called
          ‘point’. The CFA only accepts the following colors though: seal,
          chocolate, lavender and blue. The tail is long and tapers to a point.
          The Siamese coat is short, glossy and lies close to the body. The
          beauty of the Siamese cat is the look of the slender body, the blue
          eyes and the contrast between the color on the body and the darker
          color of the extremities, which can be really loved for.
        </p>
        <h3>Chapter 2: History</h3>
        <p>
          Siamese cats originated in Thailand, an area once known as Siam. Some
          stories suggest that they were first raised by Buddhist monks. Other
          tales say that the first Siamese cats were adopted by royalty. The
          first Siamese cats in Europe were a gift from the King of Siam to the
          English consulate general in Bangkok in the late 1800s. They were
          popular pets for royalty, AND for religious leaders. They were
          familiar sights in Buddhist temples for an intriguing reason. Siamese
          cats were considered sacred, because everyone thought they carried the
          souls of passed away loved ones. As a result, they were praised like
          kings and queens. Siamese cats were praised and adored in their
          homeland. For this reason they were rarely given to foreigners. But
          somehow by the 1800s they managed to make their way to england. The
          siamese was greatly appreciated for its looks! In 1871 they
          participated in the first modern feline exhibition! This show took
          place right in London’s Crystal palace! Surprisingly a journalist
          wrote afterward that Siamese cats are unnatural and a nightmare of a
          cat. As did the British because the Siamese cat quickly became very
          popular. They were especially sought after because most of them had
          crossed eyes and twisted tails. Sadly, they are considered faults
          nowadays. Siamese cats quickly conquered england. Thus, it was only a
          matter of time until they arrived in america.
