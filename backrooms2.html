        <h3>Chapter 1: What!?!?!?!</h3>
        <p>
          “What just happened!?” “Hmmm….” I wondered about what just happened
          but then he remembered his uniform said ASYNC. So he decided to call
          him an ASYNC employee and the employee said “HAHAHA! GOODNIGHT LITTLE
          KID!” And he pushed him into a black oblivion that had glitchy
          particles in them. Then, he yelled, “CURSE YOU, ASYNC!” And he passed
          out, then he said “I’ll… get… y…o…u…” but he was cut off. It was only
          him and when he was sleeping he’d forgotten all of what happened, then
          he started to snore. Very very loudly. But of course, no one heard
          him. He lay there by himself in an infinite nothing. Or so he thought.
        </p>
        <h3>Chapter 2: No-cliping. Again</h3>
        <p>
          “What the…” “Oh yeah!” I was falling to what seemed like my DOOM,
          then, I landed HARD on what seemed like concrete. Oh and how bad that
          hurt. Then I said “Owwww!”I looked around and I realized that I was no
          longer present in level 0. I then looked around to see my
          surroundings. Gray walls, water dripping from the cracked ceiling,
          wood boxes and entities racing by, WAIT, WAS THAT AN ENTITY!?!?!?
          “AHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!” I screamed and hid in a box that was old and
          damp, it was disgusting. I waited until the entity was gone. I climbed
          out and felt relieved. Then I ran over to a hallway. And lay on a wall
          before a turn. Because I heard something that sounded like music, it
          sounded something like this “WeLcOmE tO tHe EnD oF rEaLiTy, YoU oLd
          ChAP!!” it repeated over and over. I wondered why that jazzy music was
          playing.
        </p>
        <h3>Chapter 3: Welcome to the hallway, old chap</h3>
        <p>
          “WeLcOmE tO tHe EnD oF rEaLiTy, YoU oLd ChAP!!” “WeLcOmE tO tHe EnD oF
          rEaLiTy, YoU oLd ChAP!!” I was down in the hallway when I heard a
          bloodcurdling noise. It was a creepy, staticky voice. I heard “SO,
          YOU'RE HERE. THANKS FOR FALLING INTO OUR TRAP HAHAHA! TIME TO
          *CENSORED*!” T&^hen, I wnt &89 to(#()J*#the hllway

        <h3>Chaper 3 1/2: Breaking news</h3>
        <p>
          We Interrupt this book to tell you that you should skip to the next
          chapter because this chapter is getting corrupted and we advise you to
          stop reading. And move on to the next chapter before this book gets
          corrupted. Thank you for your convenience. (by the way, please
          continue)
        </p>
        <h3>Chapter 4: We return to our regularly-scheduled book</h3>
        <p>
          “AHHHHH!!!” “YOU WON'T GET ME!” (GLITCH) I ran to the end of the
          hallway. I ran past some STRANGE SIGHTS. Including an empty painting
          with a dusty frame that seemed to follow me, some gloomy marker
          written on the walls, and some overturned trash cans. “What is this
          place!??!?!” I wandered around curiously looking at every tiny crack
          and piece of debris on the wall and ground. until I saw a mannequin
          singing “WeLcOmE tO tHe EnD oF rEaLiTy, YoU oLd ChAP!!” “SO THAT’S
          WHERE THE SONG WAS COMING FROM!” I then thought to myself as I
          encountered the creepy mannequin. I inspected its dirty face and muddy
          joints with a stitched face. It seemed to be telling me something with
          its dirty grin that I couldn't understand. Then it changed what it was
          saying It sounded like this: “U#@*&)*(@)*&UHKJHRK$J(HELP)K$” So, I
          wrapped myself around the mannequin’s chest and pulled with all my
          might. I got a small tear in it. Something unbelievable happened at
          that moment. a human fell out of it. I asked him what his name was and
          he said his name was Jason then he told me that he was exploring this
          level when he, Jason paused speaking and stared into space for a
          second with a look on his face, he then continued, was possessed when
          I looked in the mannequins eyes. and got turned into a mannequin. He
          had short curly hair and a red t-shirt with some blue jeans with a few
          tears in them. “Can I come along with you?” Jason asked in despair.
          Then I shot him a caring look and replied with “Uhh…I guess so?”
          “Great!” he then exclaimed in enjoyment and we were off to lurking
          danger V1.
        </p>
        <h3>Chapter 5: Lurking danger VI</h3>
        <p>
          We started off and quickly ran into the darkness of the creepy
          manifested halls. We walked and walked until we heard a creaking
          sound. We decided to just walk by but then we saw a dusty red door. We
          blinked and then the next thing we knew was the door was open. It
          seemed just to teleport open. We both got a horrible feeling that a
          thing was staring back at us. Then we saw something. No eyes, Big
          smile, blood dripping from its glowing teeth, IT WAS A SMILER! “What
          is that?” Jason asked cunningly. “NO TIME TO EXPLAIN. JUST RUN.” I
          said frightenedly. We ran back to where we came from. Sprinting as
          fast as we could, jumping over small blocks of concrete, and almost
          tripping over every single rusty pipe we passed. We began to sweat
          even though it was surprisingly cold. We found a large crack that was
          barely big enough to fit Jason and me. We looked at each other and I
          said “It’s our only chance” of survival!” “HERE GOES NOTHING!” Jason
          yelled trying to sound heroic. So, we both jumped in. I scraped my
          knee and then he came in after me. The smiler ran past but then the
          wall we were leaning against disappeared and we both fell into a
          vortex.
        </p>
        <h3>Chapter 6: The vortex</h3>
        <p>
          I was circling in a VERY LONG VORTEX. I couldn't take it much longer.
          I began to feel very very uncomfortable, even sick! So did Jason. We
          looked at each other and hurled. We hurled so much that we almost
          drowned of our puke! Crazy, right? So, we hurled and hurled, and then
          we were no longer in there. We seemed to just teleport out but anyway.
        </p>
        <h3>Chapter 7: Back to level ☺️</h3>
        <p>
          “Oh my god!” “WHAT IS THAT!?” We ran for our lives from this entity.
          If you want to know what it looks like, here. ☺️. So, you know that
          the thing is chasing us. Oh, and by the way, we’re back in level 1,
          so, yeah. We ran again over the rusty pipes and chunks of concrete, we
          then did the same thing we found a large crack and jumped in it but
          this time the entity saw us and we had no way out the entity just
          stood there staring at us then it randomly said “Hi!” “AGGHHHH!!!!” I
          yelled. “Ha!” A voice yelled “YOU…” I said…
