        <h3>Chapter 1: Ipod classic</h3>
        <p>
            On October 23, 2001 the first IPod was introduced by Steve Jobs.
             It was called the IPod classic. 
             It was nothing like the world had seen before because the only thing close to it was the sony music player. 
             The public was also shocked by the storage capacity of 5 gigabytes which was a lot of storage at the time. 
             Especially for something that could fit into your pocket. 
             It was nicknamed by Apple 1,000 songs in your pocket because it held 1000 songs. 
             Well 1000 songs  that were each 160k which is the average song. 
             This version, the first one, cost 399$ which is equivalent to about 680$ dollars today. 
             People didn't mind spending 399$ dollars though on an IPod with 5 gigabytes.
              It had a 10 hour battery life, weighed 184 grams, and had a 2 inch display.  
              A few months later Apple introduced the 10 gigabyte IPod which was still the same version but had 10 gigabytes and costed 499$. 
              The second generation was later introduced in 2002. 
              It had the same dimensions as the first generation and also had the same design. 
              It was available 5, 10, or 20 gigabytes. That means at its maximum song capacity is 4000 songs. 
              Its starting price started at 299$. It sometimes sold for more. The third IPod was introduced in 2003. 
              It had an increase of 10 gigabytes of storage to 30 gigabytes. It had 4 storage options 5, 10, 20, or 30.  
              Due to that though it had a decrease of 2 hours in battery life down to 8 hours. 
              It had the same starting price of 299$. This one differed from the others because it was  lighter. 
              To be exact 26 grams lighter at 158 grams. It also had new backlit buttons. 
              The 4th generation was later introduced. It had two storage options 20 and 40. 
              It had an increase in battery going from 8 hours to 12. It had the same starting price of 299$. 
              In 2004 the first IPod color was introduced. That means that it had a camera and you could take pictures with it. 
              That also meant that the user could watch slideshows of their pictures while listening to music. 
              The IPod color did not come cheap though with a price 499$ for 40 gigabytes and 599$ for 60 gigabytes. 
              It did have another improvement in battery though from 12 to 15 hours. 
              1 year later, 2005 the 5th generation IPod was introduced. 
              It had a decrease in batter from 15 to 14 hours. 
              For the first time ever though you could watch videos and it had a decrease in price from 599$ to 299$. 
              The latest model of the IPod classic was introduced in 2007. It had a slightly different design. 
              It was a little bit slimmer. It also had a dramatic increase in battery life from 14 hours to 36 hours. 
              It also had an improvement in storage offering up to 180 gigabytes of storage. The IPod retailed for 249$.
        </p>
        <h3>Chapter 2: Ipod mini</h3>
        <p>In 2004 the IPod mini was introduced. During its production it was the most popular thing at the time. Normally you couldn’t find a retailer with it in stock. It had a new design and came with a touch sensitive scroll wheel. It was also the first IPod available in different colors. It had a battery life of only 8 hours. The first IPod mini had only 4 gigabytes of storage. Storing only 950 songs. It had a display of 1.7 in and weighed only 102 grams. It had a starting price of only 249$. The IPod mini lasted only for 2 generations; the second generation only had the slightest differences to the first one. It just had brighter colors and offered 6 gigabytes of storage. It also had a longer battery life of 18 hours and had a brighter screen and was 50 dollars cheaper than the first. Retailing at only 199$. It stayed in production for only 1 and 6 months.</p>
      <h3>Chapter 3: Ipod nano</h3>
      <p>The IPod Nano was introduced in 2005. Its best selling point was because of how small it was. In fact, it was more compact than the IPod Nano. It was more compact by 62% to be exact. That’s more than ⅔ smaller than its predecessor. It only came in 2 colors black and white. The first generation had three storage options. 1 gigabyte which could store 240 songs. The 2 gigabyte model which could store 500. Last but not at all least the 4 gigabyte model which can hold around 1000 songs. The first generation IPod Nano had a screen display of 1.5 in and a battery life of up to 14 hours. It was also super light, weighing only  42 grams. It costed only 150$. The second version came out soon after. It had a 2 gigabyte version in white. It had a 4 gigabyte version in 4 (colors including silver, red, yellow, and blue) and an 8 gigabyte version in black. It also included a 40% brighter and more vibrant display also equipped with 24 hours of battery life. Later that year Apple introduced teh (product)red version for every unit sold 10$ dollars was donated to the red initiative. The 3rd generation introduced in 2007 had an entirely new design. It had a wide display but the price stayed the same (149$). The following year the 4th generation came out. It came in multiple colors. The display size remained the same but it was turned into a vertical display. It also came with a 16 gigabyte option. Later the 5th generation was introduced. It was equipped with a state of the art microphone and camera. The screen display was also increased by 0.2 inches. From 2.0 inches to 2.2 inches. In 2010 Apple made an abrupt change of the design to the IPod Nano design. It featured a small 1.55 inch multi touch touchscreen. It had a nickname of the “the tiniest IPod ever.” It had a 24 hour battery life and you could get in with 8 or 16 gigabytes. It weighed 20 grams. It had the same starting price of 149$. The latest model of the IPod Nano was released in 2012 and featured the old design. Other than the fact that it was 40% thinner than its predecessor.  It also had access to bluetooth headset and speakers. It had a new charging port instead of the old one it replaced. It had a slot for a lightning connector. It came with 16 gigabytes of storage and an impressive 30 hours battery life. That’s an improvement of 6 hours. Over all the IPod Nano stayed in production for 12 whole years and was later discontinued in 2017.</p>
      <h3>Chapter 4: Ipod shuffle</h3>
      <p>According to Apple research most customers and users of previous IPods had it on the shuffle mode. Which means they enjoy their music entertainment in a random order. The IPod shuffle did not feature a screen. You could turn your IPod shuffle on to three different modes: Shuffle, off, and repeat. The IPod shuffle had a usb sticking out of it so you can download songs onto it. Due to its lack of screen it only costs 99$. It also only weighed  22 grams and had a 12 hour battery face. It only came with 512 megabytes or 1 gigabyte. Later that year they came out with the second generation. It came in multiple colors. Such as pink, yellow, blue, and silver. It was also marketed as “Worlds smallest MP3”. It weighed only fifteen grams. It came with 1 gigabyte of storage and retailed for only 79$. The next year a very strange IPod was introduced. It lost 2 hours in battery from 12 to 10 hours. The latest shuffle was introduced in 2010 and was very much like the second generation. Except for the fact that the battery life was improved by a whole 3 hours. It was the cheapest IPod ever made. Retailing only for 49$. </p>
    <h3>Chapter 5: Ipod touch</h3>
    <p>	The IPod touch released in 2007 was unlike any other IPod ever released previously. It was much like the IPhone released a couple of months earlier. Like the IPhone the IPod Touch had a 3.5 inch display. You could download many apps. This allowed the user to browse the web, watch youtube videos, and play games. In fact it was the main selling point. It had a starting price of 299$ and had a battery life of 22 hours. You could get it with either 8 or 16 gigabytes. The second generation later came out. It featured a 32 gigabyte option and had integrated volume buttons. Another improvement was its battery life which was improved by 14 hours to 36 hours. The retail price dropped to only 229$. Which made it more affordable. Soon in 2009 the 3rd generation was introduced to the public. It did have a higher starting price but it did come with 64 gigabytes of storage. The battery was also decreased to 30 hours. Soon after the 4th generation was introduced. It held a totally different design. It included a front and back camera for selfies and video calls. It also featured the all new Apple 4 chip which improved its overall processing speed. It was the first iPod touch to feature a retina display. The battery was also improved to a whole 40 hours. The retail price was considerably low although it underwent all these upgrades. It cost only 229$. Next year the fifth generation was introduced. It came in many colors and the screen size was increased to 4 inches. The boring old plug was replaced by the new lightning connector for fast charging. Most of the statistics were similar though it retailed at 299$. 2 years after the 6th generation of the IPod Touch was introduced. It came in many colors that had not been available on the market before. The camera was improved to 8mp. It had a low starting price of only 199$. Finally the latest version of the IPod was introduced in 2019 and was the 7th generation. It used the all new Apple 10 processor which made it much faster and more advanced than its predecessor.  For the first time there was a 256 gigabyte option. It retailed for only 199$. The IPod was still for sale until 2022 may 10 when it was finally discontinued.</p>
