        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          Hi. If you’re reading this, I just want you to know I am being chased
          by a peach thing and I don’t have much time to talk. If you want to
          hear HOW THE HECK THIS HAPPENED, Continue reading. Also, This is book
          one in my series so, I have one more word for you. HELP!!!!!!!!! (By
          the way, please continue)
        </p>
        <h3>Chapter 1: Earth</h3>
        <p>
          “Rolling!” “3… 2… 1… ACTION!” I was a director for a movie that me and
          my friends were making. It was called “The attack of the apes.” We
          were starting the 1st scene where the characters were introduced. We
          had been planning this for a long time and we were actually doing it.
          So, we started to film. It actually went pretty well! So, we started
          scene 2, where the ape breaks out of the zoo. And guess what happened,
          IT DIDN’T RECORD. So, we started it again. It finally worked this
          time. We took a brief intermission to grab chips and guacamole to
          celebrate completing 2 scenes already. We were talking about what
          should be for scene 3. Fred told me that it should be where the ape
          eats someone and everyone panics and runs for their lives! Todd
          suggested that it should be where the zookeeper's capture the ape with
          a net but the ape escapes from the net by breaking it and sets all the
          prisoners free at the jail by accident when he was really trying to
          eat the cell for food. So, we started to film. It was tedious, but
          turned out good. We followed the format. Plan, film. Plan, film Plan,
          Film. Plan, film until we reached scene 6. When the ape sees the
          camera and goes for it. But, I didn't see the curb until I fell. I
          braced for impact but I went through the ground and everything went
          black.
        </p>
        <h3>Chapter 2: Level 0</h3>
        <p>
          “Ughh…” “Where am I?” I woke up and I could feel something wet on my
          face, shirt, and pants. I stood up to find myself In a yellow room
          with buzzing fluorescent lights and a wet, moldy carpet. “Hello?”
          Nobody answered. I was starting to get worried about where my friends
          were. Just then, I saw something zip by that was black. I quickly hid
          in a dingy corner. I was going to panic. I turned around the corner to
          see a hideous, black creature staring right back at me! I was
          paralyzed in fear! It quickly ran around me, then ran away. I was
          confused. So, I ran with all my might until I found a note. It said,
          “Guide to escaping the Backroom’s entities. Duller: Stay still. But
          that’s all it said because the rest was ripped off. I checked the
          back. It said: “Go to different areas to find new techniques to escape
          different entities” Okay? I said and my journey was starting and I was
          pumped to get to the next level.
        </p>
        <h3>Chaper 3: The outer reaches of level 0</h3>
        <p>
          “ROAR!” “Ahhhhh!” There was a new creature. It was chasing me. I was
          running for my life. It was some sort of dog-creature and it sounded
          like a nightmare! I was screaming! I hid in a corner to catch my
          breath. It ran by and I was safe. I noticed something sticking out of
          the ground. It was, Almond water? I drank it because I was so thirsty.
          And suddenly, I felt refreshed! I continued walking until I found a
          slide. “What the…?” I thought. It said “Choose the right one. Get it
          right, continue. Get it wrong, DIE.” So, I chose the red one. A door
          locked behind me and I slid down. I slid down for what seemed like an
          hour. Then, I reached the exit of the slide. I looked at the blue
          slide and there was a grate that seemed to have you-know-whatted
          people. I ran into the depths of the underground area.
        </p>
        <h3>Chapter 4: The underground section</h3>
        <p>
          “Hello?” “Where am I?” I wandered around the darkened halls of the
          underground area until I heard something that sounded like a scream. I
          quickly turned around to see a hazmat suit on the ground. I put it on,
          just in case I needed it. So, I continued to wander around but then I
          saw a glowing light. I wondered what it was, so I stepped into the
          light.
        </p>
        <h3>Chapter 5: The kitchen</h3>
        <p>
          “Wait…” “Is that food?” I encountered a table and counters, pantries,
          an oven, a microwave, and more appliances for a kitchen. I opened all
          the drawers. No luck. So, I opened all the pantries. I got lucky. I
          saw a box of cheerios on the counter so I opened it and GUESS what was
          in it. AN ENTITY TRAP, ACTUALLY! So, I kept onto the entity trap and
          continued to look for food to take on the way. Then, I noticed
          something on the counter. I picked it up and it was automatically
          glued on the paper for the entities.It was for a… SMILER!?!?! “What is
          that!?” I thought to myself as I continued to look at the paper. It
          said, “The way to get rid of a smiler is by using, AN ENTITY TRAP like
          the one you found in the cheerio box.” “Oh!” I said. I found some
          candy bars and hit the road. Just then, I hit a wall and I suddenly
          was teleported to an area that was different from what I’ve seen
          before.
        </p>
        <h3>Chapter 6: The manila room</h3>
        <p>
          “Oh no…” “WHAT IS THAT!?!??!” I was running for my life from this…
          THING. Oh, And also, now that you all up to the story of what happened
          now you know why I’m running for my life. So, I ran for the walls in
          hope of teleporting out of here. And nothing happened so I ran for the
          door that the tan blob-of-a-human went into. I went in and I fell into
          a void of pitch black nothing. I could hear some ghostly whispers like
          “RUN…” “You don’t belong here” “YOU WILL *Censored*” I saw a ledge. I
          went for it and landed on it HARD. Then, I went black.
        </p>
        <h3>Chapter 7: The void</h3>
        <p>
          “...What happened?” “Where am I?” I stood up and remembered that I
          needed to get out of there. So, I opened the door and exited the void.
          ONLY TO BE BRUNG INTO A CREEPY ROOM! The room was eerie and quiet. I
          was worried about any entity around the premises. Suddenly a new
          entity emerged from the shadow. It had white eyes and it had a no
          body. It WAS A SMILER!!!!! I ran for my life and then suddenly I heard
          a voice “GET BACK!” The voice yelled. I turned around and it was an
          ASYNC employee! “Gotta go, see ya!” he said as he disappeared into the
          darkness.
